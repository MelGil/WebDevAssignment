            <h1> Cautions and Warnings </h1>
            <p>With any form of social media there are always downsides. Depending on the age catagory of the individual using any apps particulary 
            the younger age it should be monitored so the app is being used for the approperiate reasons. TikToc is an app that can be used for reasons 
            other than educational and therefore can pose a threat to the younger generation if they are influenced to part take in content not approperiate for their age.</p>
            <h1> Using TikTok for Learning</h1>
            <p>Using social media for education is a big thing today. Even things like moodle for college
work would be fairly recent. There are other platforms such as Slack and Kahoot to also
aid the learning process.

Depending on the subject of learning, popular apps like Instagram and Twitter can also
be used educationally. Using specific hashtags on these apps is a great way to keep up to
date with work being done by the particular group. TikTok can also use hashtags to
specify what videos are for teaching/learning.
TikTok is a Chinese video sharing platform made in 2012. It was available globally in
2017. Since then, TikTok has developed many different uses, some of them involving
teaching and learning.
Before even thinking about anything academic, TikTok has been a place where you could
learn something new. These include the popular video topic “life hacks”. This is where a
user explains a trick to use in everyday life to make a certain task or chore a little more
manageable. Other things you could learn from Tik Tok also include cooking, fitness
tips, and even how to do the most popular dance trends.
The most obvious example of TikTok being used for education however, is when the
#EduTok programme was launched. This is a form of eLearning where users can post
videos to teach others about various different topics, ranging from fitness workouts to
solving mathematical equations. As of its launch, the genre of videos has received over
48 billion views on the app. </p>
